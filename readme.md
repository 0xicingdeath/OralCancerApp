#Oral Cancer App 

This app was created during Deltahacks, a 24 hour-student-run McMaster Hackathon for a pharmacist from Juravinski Cancer Centre in Hamilton. 

It provides oral cancer patients with quick up to date information - including what to do if they miss a dose, how to get into contact with their primary health care providers, and other vital information. 

##Things to Improve 

 1. Currently, all the data is hard coded (as per limited time in a Hackathon), and I want to make it much more efficient by building a proper back-end to it. 
 2. Pulling updated information via a server 

##Things I learned 

 + I learnt Android studio on the spot to create this app, never programmed anything other than Java and a basic functional language (ELM) 
 + I learned how to create android front-ends and how to link pages together
