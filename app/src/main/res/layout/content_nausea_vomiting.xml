Nausea and vomiting can mostly be controlled with medication. \n\n What you can do to help prevent nausea and vomiting: \n\n 1. Eat a low-fat meal before treatment. \n 2. Limit spicy, fried foods and food with strong smells. \n 3. Take medications discussed with your nurse, pharmacist or doctor (Regular medication is taken on a regular schedule and as needed medication is only taken when required). \n\n\n What might help: \n 1. Relaxation and diversification techniques (things youc an do to take your mind off the nausea and vomiting such as resting quietly, watching TV, reading, listening to music or doing yoga) \n 2. Drinking clear fluids \n 3. Eating several small meals a day and slowly. \n 4. Relaxing after eating, reamining in a sitting position (this helps you digest your food better). \n 5. Get some fresh air. \n\n Make sure that you get your anti-vomiting medication prescriptions filled. Take the medications prescribed by your oncologists. \n\n Make sure to call your Primary team if you continue having nausea and vomiting. If you go to an Emergency Department, tell the staff that you are on anticancer drugs."
